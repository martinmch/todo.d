# todo.d

> A simple and extensible shell script for managaing your tasks in a directory.

todo.d is a computer program (currently written in bash) for easily tracking
tasks. All tasks correspond to a single file. 

It is a command-line tool, but writing web, desktop and terminal interfaces is
possible. todo.d was inspired by todo.txt and have similarities.

todo.d aims to help gain clarity and control of tasks. A place to aggregate all
your todos, whether they come from GitLab, Outlook, a paper note or something
else.

The goal of todo.d is to create a task manager as simple as possible, without
sacrificing core features. The software should be usable and reliable and
conform to security standards.
